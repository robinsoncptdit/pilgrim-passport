Here are some straightforward, human-readable suggestions for each .mdc file. Note that these are purely recommendations for clarification or completeness. I am not modifying the existing file contents—just offering ideas on how you might improve or expand each document in the future.

⸻

1. clerk-setup-refactoring-maintenance.mdc
	•	Check the spelling of “authMideware” (you might want “authMiddleware”).
	•	Provide a brief example of how to replace existing authMiddleware imports with clerkMiddleware, especially in a Next.js file or folder structure.
	•	Expand on how to protect app routes beyond the mention to “start” with them—maybe add a short snippet illustrating the usage in middleware.ts.

⸻

2. commit-messages.mdc
	•	Include a quick sample commit message from start to finish (e.g., “Feat(component): add new component\n\nSome detail about what changed.\n\n💾 Don’t forget to commit!”) so readers clearly see how the reminder lines up.
	•	Consider adding guidelines about the size or scope of commits to maintain clarity (e.g., “keep commits small and focused on a single change”).

⸻

3. database-integration.mdc
	•	Possibly add a brief note about environment variables for database connections (e.g., .env usage) or how you typically structure them in Next.js.
	•	If you commonly handle concurrency issues or mention transactions, you might provide a short code snippet on prisma.$transaction.
	•	Suggest more examples for handling errors or implementing re-try logic, especially for known Prisma error codes.

⸻

4. file-folder-component-creation.mdc
	•	Clarify if "use client" is for every component or just those that need client-side interactivity (e.g., forms, modals, etc.).
	•	Add a small mention of how to keep your Tailwind config in sync with Next.js 13’s or 14’s folder structure, if you’re using the latest.
	•	Provide an example of how to leverage shadcn/ui components in a simple scenario, so developers see it in context.

⸻

5. install-shadcn.mdc
	•	Maybe add a short note describing why npx shadcn@latest init is the new recommended approach (e.g., improved tooling, compatibility).
	•	Clarify the difference between npx install shadcn vs npx install shadcn-ui@latest if relevant, so users understand possible version or command changes.
	•	You could also reference how to handle updates to shadcn if the tool is updated in the future.

⸻

6. project-mangement-document-creation.mdc
	•	Include guidelines on how to structure or name your tasks in the “Tasks are ordered chronologically” section. For instance, do you group them by date or by feature?
	•	Add a mention about who updates these tasks, how frequently, or in which scenarios they should be moved from “Pending” to “Done.”
	•	Consider adding a quick reference to additional labels or tags (like “Blocked,” “In Progress,” etc.) if you use them.

⸻

7. robshocks-react-component-rules.mdc
	•	You might clarify the difference between “use-client” components and server components in Next.js 13+ for new developers.
	•	Add a note on whether or not certain components can remain server-side if they don’t require interactivity, especially if you’re optimizing performance.
	•	Include a mention of the recommended approach to state management (e.g., Redux, Zustand, or React context) if it’s relevant to your typical workflow.

⸻

In summary, these documents look solid and cover core references well. The suggestions above simply expand or clarify details to help avoid confusion when you or others read them in the future.
