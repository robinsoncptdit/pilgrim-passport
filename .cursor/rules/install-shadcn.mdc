## Handling Future Updates
If the shadcn tool is updated or introduces new commands, periodically check the official documentation or run:

npx shadcn@latest ‚Äìhelp

to see any updated usage. If your project was set up with:

npx shadcn@latest init

you can typically use a similar command (e.g., `npx shadcn@latest upgrade` if supported) to upgrade to the latest features and components without losing custom code. Always review any CLI prompts that ask whether to overwrite or keep existing files.
